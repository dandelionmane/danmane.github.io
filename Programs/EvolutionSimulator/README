Abstract: There is a world of 'blobs' which have 4 principle attributes, determined by DNA:

- Photosynthesis: Ability to continuously generate energy
- Speed: Ability to move, at the expense of energy
- Attack: Ability to damage other blobs, at the expense of energy
- Efficency: Lower energy cost for all activities

Programming Projects

Plottable.js - An Open Source Library for Data Visualization
* Lead Developer & Architect (5 Person Team)
Plottable.js is an open-source library that takes a modular, component-based approach to building data visualizations

I led development from the [first line of code](https://github.com/palantir/plottable/commit/2854c7e61a816f457b1baef1e7bce60060777c00) and grew it into a 5 person team building a library used throughout Palantir
